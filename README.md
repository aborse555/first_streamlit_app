# My First Streamlit App

For Badge 2: Data Application Builders Workshop of Snowflake Learning, we had to make a streamlit app. 
This app/website is a diner menu with features such as pick and choose your own fruits with nutritional information about those fruits, two answer boxes. 
The first one gives you additional information about the fruit of your choice.
The second one allows you to request fruits to add to the menu, which are then uploaded into Snowflake.
I was able to use multiple different skills to create this app including: Snowflake, Python, Streamlit, API's, Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Riverly.
The link to the website is https://aborse555-first-streamlit-app-streamlit-app-w0433r.streamlit.app/
